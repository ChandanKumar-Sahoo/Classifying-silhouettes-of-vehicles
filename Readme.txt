Classifying Silhouettes of Vehicles



? Main purpose is to classify the vehicles into the respective labels using the numerical attributes from the given geometric features extracted from Silhouette by applying dimensionlaity reduction technique - PCA and train a model using Principal components instead of training the model using just the raw data.


? The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

? All the features are geometric features extracted from the silhouette.
? All are numeric in nature
